### Hi there, I'm Jules ðŸ‘‹
I'm a freshly graduated engineer from Centrale Lyon (France) and DTU (Denmark) with a deep focus on Data Science & Machine Learning. I've been working for a while on NLP and how to scale massive models like BERT in production. I also got a R&D internship on anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series.


- :snake: Iâ€™m a Python enthusiast and fascinated by NLP.
- :bulb: Iâ€™m currently learning __Scala__ and willing to specialize in Data Engineering in general.
- ðŸ“« I'm checking [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jules-belveze/) daily, so feel free to reach out.
- :sweat_smile: Just bought myself a Redox keyboard and trying to get used to it.
