I'm employed as an <b>NLP / MLOps Engineer</b> at @Hypefactors where I work on various multilingual natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis, NER, topic modeling, summarization, ... and how to leverage it for business usage. We are investing a lot of effort in automating the whole machine learning lifecycle. We have adopted the following tools to help us in this direction:
- [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io) for data annotation
- [Neptune.ai](https://neptune.ai) for experiment tracking and data versioning
- [ONNXruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai) for faster inference to help us scale our Deep Learning models
- [Metaflow](https://docs.metaflow.org) to manage and schedule data science workflows

As you will notice if looking at my repos, I spent quite some time working with Deep Learning and Time Series and did my Master Thesis on <i>Anomaly Detection In High Dimensional Time Series.</i>. Also, I'm particularly interested in new SOTA techniques to speed up the inference of Transformer based models.
