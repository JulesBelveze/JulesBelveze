I'm a graduated engineer from both Centrale Lyon (France) and DTU (Denmark) with a deep focus on Data Science & AI. 
I've been working for a while on NLP and how to leverage it for business usage. I also have a strong interest in Engineering problems and especially how to scale massive models like <i>BERT</i> in production. 
As you will notice if looking at my repos, I spent quite some time working with Deep Learning and Time Series and did my Master Thesis on <i>Anomaly Detection In High Dimensional Time Series.</i>
