I'm a NLP Engineer working for @hypefactors. I graduated from both Centrale Lyon (France) and DTU (Denmark) with a deep focus on Data Science & AI. 
I've been working for a while on multilingual NLP for various cases like sentiment analysis, NER, topic modeling, ... and how to leverage it for a business usage. I  have a strong interest in MLOps and Engineering problems and especially how to scale massive models like <i>BERT</i> in production.

As you will notice if looking at my repos, I spent quite some time working with Deep Learning and Time Series and did my Master Thesis on <i>Anomaly Detection In High Dimensional Time Series.</i>
