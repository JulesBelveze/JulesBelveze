<h3> What I do </h3>
I'm employed as an <b>NLP / MLOps Engineer</b> at @Hypefactors where I work on various **multilingual natural language processing** tasks like sentiment analysis, NER, topic modeling, summarization, ... and how to leverage them for our clients. \
\
At Hypefactors we are investing a lot of effort in automating our whole machine learning lifecycle. We believe that automating model development & deployment using MLOps means faster feature releases. To help us achieve this we have adopted the following tools to help us in this direction: [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai), [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/), [Neptune.ai](https://neptune.ai), [ONNXruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai), [Metaflow](https://docs.metaflow.org), [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io) ...

<h3> About me </h3>
As you will notice if looking at my repos, I spent quite some time working with Deep Learning and Time Series and did my Master Thesis on <i>Anomaly Detection In High Dimensional Time Series.</i>. Also, I'm particularly interested in new SOTA techniques to speed up the inference of Transformer based models.
